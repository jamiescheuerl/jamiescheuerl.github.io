			<h2>Intagers and Binary</h2>
			<h4>Integers can be represented in binary by using either 1 or 0</h4>
			<h4>For example the integer 2 would be read by the computer as by 010 or 10 but the integer 3 would be 011 or 11 (tip: binary numbers are different from normal numbers so 11 would be one one, not eleven.)</h4>
			
			<h2>Program Example</h2>
			<h4>You have a simple program where the user will input 3 numbers between 1 and 10 and at the end the program will tell the user those numbers</h4>
			<h4>the user then inputs 3 random numbers :</h4>
			<h4></h4>
			<h2>Input</h2>
			<h3>
				<ol>
					<li>  3</li>
					<li>  9</li>
					<li>  5</li>
				</ol>
			<h3>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<h4></h4>
			<h4>When inserted the number 3 would be processed by the computer as 011 </h4>
			<h4>When inserted the number 9 would be processed by the computer as 1001</h4>
			<h4>When inserted the number 5 would be processed by the computer as 101</h4>
			
			<h2>Output</h2>
			<h4>After being processed 011 will be convered back into 3 and displayed as 3</h4>
			<h4>After being processed 101 will be convered back into 9 and displayed as 9</h4>
			<h4>After being processed 1001 will be convered back into 5 and displayed as 5</h4>
